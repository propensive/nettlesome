# Nettlesome

__Typesafe IP address representations for Scala__

We often need to work with 32-bit IPv4, and increasingly, 128-bit IPv6 addresses. While
IPv4 addresses have a relatively simple form, IPv6 addresses are more complex, and parsing
and serializing them is more complex. Nettlesome provides both facilities, as well as
lifting parsing of statically-known IP addresses to compiletime.

## Features

- Represent IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
- IPv4 addresses are efficiently stored as a single opaque `Int`
- Compile-time parsing of IP addresses with the `ip""` interpolator
- Runtime parsing and canonical serialization of addresses


## Availability

Nettlesome has not yet been published as a binary.

## Getting Started

### Creating an IP address

To create an IP address value, either an `Ipv4` or `Ipv6`, from a known string, such as `192.168.1.12`
or `2000:abcd:1234::5:12`, simply write it inside quotes prefixed with `ip`, like so:
```scala
val address1: Ipv4 = ip"192.168.1.12"
val address2: Ipv6 = ip"2000:abcd:1234::5:12"
```

The same `ip` interpolator is used for both types, and the return type will adapt to the content.

A mistake in the content will result in a compile error, for example `ip"192.168.1.2.3"` will fail to
compile because there are five `.`-separated integers, rather than four.

In particular, for IPv4 addresses, the parser checks for,
 - exactly four groups
 - only integers in the range 0-255
 - no non-integer characters, other than `.`

and for IPv6 addresses,
 - a maximum of eight `:`-separated groups
 - at most one `::` separator
 - between one and four hexadecimal characters for each group

### Parsing an IP address

The same parser can be used at runtime, throwing an `IpAddressError` in the event of an incorrect address.

To parse an IP address from a `Text` value, use the `parse` method of either the `Ipv4` or `Ipv6` objects,
for example,
```scala
val address1: Ipv4 = Ipv4.parse(t"192.168.1.12")
val address2: Ipv6 = Ipv6.parse(ipAddressText)
```

### Serializing IP addresses

Both `Ipv4` and `Ipv6` addresses have `Show` instances, which will serialize these addresse to `Text` values.
IPv4 addresses will be serialized, unsurprisingly, as four integers interspersed with `.` characters, and
IPv6 addresses will be serialized according to the
[IETF's recommended canonical representation](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5952), which includes
various simplifications.



## Status

Nettlesome is classified as __embryonic__. For reference, Scala One projects are
categorized into one of the following five stability levels:

- _embryonic_: for experimental or demonstrative purposes only, without any guarantees of longevity
- _fledgling_: of proven utility, seeking contributions, but liable to significant redesigns
- _maturescent_: major design decisions broady settled, seeking probatory adoption and refinement
- _dependable_: production-ready, subject to controlled ongoing maintenance and enhancement; tagged as version `1.0.0` or later
- _adamantine_: proven, reliable and production-ready, with no further breaking changes ever anticipated

Projects at any stability level, even _embryonic_ projects, are still ready to
be used, but caution should be taken if there is a mismatch between the
project's stability level and the importance of your own project.

Nettlesome is designed to be _small_. Its entire source code currently consists
of 391 lines of code.

## Building

Nettlesome can be built on Linux or Mac OS with [Fury](/propensive/fury), however
the approach to building is currently in a state of flux, and is likely to
change.

## Contributing

Contributors to Nettlesome are welcome and encouraged. New contributors may like to look for issues marked
<a href="https://github.com/propensive/nettlesome/labels/beginner">beginner</a>.

We suggest that all contributors read the [Contributing Guide](/contributing.md) to make the process of
contributing to Nettlesome easier.

Please __do not__ contact project maintainers privately with questions unless
there is a good reason to keep them private. While it can be tempting to
repsond to such questions, private answers cannot be shared with a wider
audience, and it can result in duplication of effort.

## Name

_Nettlesome_ provides the slightly irritating (or _nettlesome_) task of working with _network_ addresses,
which it alludes to in its first three letters.

In general, Scala One project names are always chosen with some rationale, however it is usually
frivolous. Each name is chosen for more for its _uniqueness_ and _intrigue_ than its concision or
catchiness, and there is no bias towards names with positive or "nice" meaningsâ€”since many of the
libraries perform some quite unpleasant tasks.

Names should be English words, though many are obscure or archaic, and it should be noted how
willingly English adopts foreign words. Names are generally of Greek or Latin origin, and have
often arrived in English via a romance language.
