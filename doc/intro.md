We often need to work with 32-bit IPv4, and increasingly, 128-bit IPv6 addresses. While
IPv4 addresses have a relatively simple form, IPv6 addresses are more complex, and parsing
and serializing them is more complex. Nettlesome provides both facilities, as well as
lifting parsing of statically-known IP addresses to compiletime.
